        <p>
          Hello! I'm Al Hasanul Banna, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer
          with a primary focus on React.js front-end development. With a strong
          foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I possess extensive expertise
          in building responsive and mobile-friendly websites. React.js is my
          go-to framework, and I thrive on leveraging its power to develop
          dynamic and interactive front-end solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my main focus is on front-end development, my skill set extends
          to the back-end as well. I am proficient in Node.js and have
          experience working with databases like MongoDB, which allows me to
          seamlessly integrate the front-end with the server-side logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging
          from small business websites to complex web applications. I have
          collaborated closely with clients, understanding their unique needs
          and translating them into practical solutions. I take pride in my
          ability to communicate effectively and deliver projects on time,
          ensuring client satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy staying updated with the latest industry
          trends and exploring new technologies. This curiosity fuels my
          continuous learning journey, allowing me to deliver cutting-edge
          solutions to my clients.
